Rene Descartes and Pierre Fermat are both listed among the creators of modern analytic geometry. However, the relationship between the two has been anything but smooth.

[Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes) became a widely regarded authority on subjects ranging from philosophy to mathematics. His contributions to math include such fundamentals as the usage of *x* and *y* to describe the unknown values. Through his prolific publications, Descartes developed authority and reputation far beyond France.

[Pierre Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat) had none of the authority or reputation. A provincial lawyer from Toulouse, Fermat dabbled with mathematical problems in his spare time, which also had to accommodate his five children.
